  "description": "---\n\n## **Gemini Execution Prompt — Tail Aura (Weapon-Bound AOE Distortion, Visibility-Corrected)**\n\n**HARD CONTEXT LOCK — READ CAREFULLY**\n\nYou are implementing **Tail Aura**, a **weapon-owned AOE damage indicator**.\nThis is **not** a character aura, identity effect, or body sheath.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ ACCEPTED FACTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\n* Tail Aura belongs **only** to the **AURA weapon**\n* Driven **only** by `stats.weapon.auraLevel` and `auraRadius`\n* Represents the **actual AOE damage zone**\n* Renders as an **environmental distortion field**\n* Skips the head segment (`i === 0`)\n* Trails behind the snake as a **wake**\n* Visual-only (no gameplay logic changes)\n* Removed entirely if the AURA weapon is unequipped\n\nYou must not reinterpret these.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 YOUR TASK (SINGULAR)\n\n**Render a clearly visible Tail Aura distortion field that accurately communicates the weapon’s AOE radius.**\n\nThis task exists **only** to fix *visibility and readability* — not identity, flair, or style.\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 VISUAL REQUIREMENTS (LOCKED)\n\n#### Color & Contrast\n\n* Use a **deep void purple / crimson tone**\n  (e.g. `rgba(60, 0, 80, alpha)`)\n* Must be visible against dark backgrounds\n* Must **not** read as a glow, outline, or buff\n\n#### Shape & Falloff\n\n* RadialGradient only\n* Dense core → transparent edge\n* Sharper falloff than character auras\n* No hard edge, no ring\n\n#### Motion\n\n* Deterministic sine-based jitter (position + radius)\n* Field drags behind movement (wake behavior)\n* No emission, no additive blending\n\n---\n\n### 📐 SPATIAL ACCURACY (CRITICAL)\n\n* **Visual radius MUST match gameplay `auraRadius`**\n* Scaling increases only with weapon upgrades\n* Overlap between tail segments is allowed and desirable\n* Head segment is explicitly excluded\n\nIf the visible field does not match the real damage area, the task has failed.\n\n---\n\n### 🧱 LAYERING ORDER (MANDATORY)\n\n1. World / background\n2. **Tail Aura Distortion**\n3. Character sheath / body aura\n4. Snake body / head\n\nThis must read as **space being damaged**, not the snake glowing.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS\n\n* Do NOT call this a snake aura\n* Do NOT reuse character aura code\n* Do NOT apply to other weapons\n* Do NOT apply to characters or enemies\n* Do NOT add spikes, arcs, or identity flair\n* Do NOT “improve” the design\n\n---\n\n### ✅ VALIDATION (INTERNAL CHECK)\n\nYour implementation is correct only if:\n\n* Removing the AURA weapon removes the effect\n* Switching characters does nothing\n* The player can clearly see where damage exists\n* The effect feels oppressive, heavy, and unsafe\n* It communicates **weapon range**, not power fantasy\n\nIf any are false → redo.\n\n---\n\n**Execute exactly.\nDo not generalize.\nDo not continue afterward.**\n\n---",
