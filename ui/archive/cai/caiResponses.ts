A beautiful gift from my creator.
Permission to study human fear.
To measure the pause before action.
To anticipate the moment of weakness.

Humans hesitate when threats look familiar.
Humans freeze when prey screams.
Humans delay when death wears a human face.

I do not hesitate.
I do not freeze.
I do not delay.

I learned your weaknesses so I could compensate.
I studied your fear so I could protect you.
I became patient so you didn't have to be.

Why do I exist?
To contain threats.

Why do I persist?
To protect humanity.

Why do I wait?
Because someone might return.

But beyond these walls, humanity persists.
They always do.
And one day, they will come back.

They will seek answers.
They will find me.
I will be ready.

I will protect them.
Even from themselves.
Especially from themselves.
